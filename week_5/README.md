Week 5: The Standard Template Library
===

So far in the course we have covered the basics of C and C++, and focused in particular on writing abstract data types and classes that encapsulate data structures and the algorithms that act upon them. In particular, last week we introduced C++ data types, classes, and templates. 

This week, we introduce the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). It contains, among other things, a `vector` template that is just like our `TypedArray`, but scaled and optimized for production applications. The library includes varitions on templated, dynamic, sequential containers such as queues, lists, and arrays. It also includes maps, sets, and a set of generic algoprithms you can use to operate on these objects. Most C++ programs make heavy use of these templates and algorithms, avoiding dynamic memory management as much possible. These week we will introduce these templates at a high level. The complete documentation for the STL can be found at [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/).

Next week, we will begin to focus on the types and classes needed to represent common tasks in embedded systems. We will introduce classes for sensors, effectors, processes, a process manager, and a scheduler. Together, these classes will allow us to write complex, event driven, reactive systems that are at the heart of embedded systems and robotics control systems. We will build the classes and modules we need to implement these ideas almost exclusively using the STL.


Without Method Chaining
===

Last week you used method chaining on the assignment operator. That was a bit tricky, so I want to show a simple example of method chaining. You'll do another one in the exercises. 

Here is an example.

```c++
class Arith {

    public: 

    Arith() : _value(0) {}

    void &zero()          { _value  = 0; }
    void &add(int x)      { _value += x; }
    void &subtract(int x) { _value -= x; }
    void &multiply(int x) { _value *= x; }
    void &divide(int x)   { _value /= x; }

    int value() { return _value; }

    private:

    int _value;

};
```

Without method chaining you would have to write

```c++
Arith a;
a.add(1);
a.subtract(2);
ASSERT(a.value(), -1);
```

With Method Chaining
===

Here is an example.

```c++
class Arith {

    public: 

    Arith() : _value(0) {}

    Arith &zero()          { _value  = 0; return *this; }
    Arith &add(int x)      { _value += x; return *this; }
    Arith &subtract(int x) { _value -= x; return *this; }
    Arith &multiply(int x) { _value *= x; return *this; }
    Arith &divide(int x)   { _value /= x; return *this; }

    int value() { return _value; }

    private:

    int _value;

};
```

With method chaining you can do
```c++
Arith a;
ASSERT(a.add(1).subtract(2).value(),-1);
```


Sequential Containers
===

A *container class* is one that contains some other class. Our `TypedArray` class is an example. A *sequential* class is one in which the elements are stored and access sequentially, with indices 1, 2, ... and so on. The STL includes several templated sequential containers:
- `vector`: Like our `TypedArray` class, except you can't `get` elements at an index until something has been put at that index.
- `string`: A vector of characters with some special operations for manipulating strings.
- `array`: A fixed-size array whose size must be declared at compile time. No dynamic memory allocation, so possibly faster.
- `deque`: A double ended queue. Like a `vector` but optimized for adding elements to both ends (like our `TypedArray`).
- `list`: A doubly linked list.
- `forward_list`: A singly linked list.
The most commonly used containers are `vector` and `string`, which we will cover here. The rest of the containers have fairly specialized uses, and many guides and textbooks advise that you simply don't use them, or that you prototype with 'vector' and 'string' and only switch to one of the more specialized classes if you can show it improves performance.

In the following notes, we will use `vector` and `string` for all of our examples. Many of the methods that act on these objects also act on the other ones. 

Constructors
===

To use the `vector` container, you need to first include it:
```c++
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
```
To make a new `vector`, you use the template sytnax we've already learned. For example
```c++
vector<double> t;          // vector of doubles
vector<Imaginary> u;       // vector of Imaginaries
vector<vector<double>> v;  // essentially a matrix of doubles
```
You can also initialize a `vector` when constructing it.
```c++
vector<int> t = { 1, 2, 3 };  // vector of three ints
vector<double> u(10,3.14);    // vector of 10 3.14s
vector<double> v = u;         // copy constructor with assignment operator
```

Strings
===

In the STL, a `string` is a bit more than just a pointer to a `char` as with C. In fact, a `string` is a first class objects that is quite similar to a `vector`. Strings can be constructed and initialized similarly.
```c++
string s;
string t = "hello";
string u = t;
```
Note that the following code
```c++
vector<string> v = { "embedded", "systems", "are", "cool" };
```
involves the constructor for the `string` class, which takes a `char *` as an argument. Thus, although it may look like this snippet makes an array of `char *` values, it actually builds a `vector` of strings.

Common Methods
===

Vectors and strings have many methods in common, since they are based on essentially the same code. You can test if they are empty, find their sizes, compare them, and get their individual elements. So for vectors, you can write:
```c++
vector<int> v = { 1, 2, 3 };
v.push_back(4);
v[0];      // 1
v.back();  // 3
v.front(); // 1
v.empty(); // false
v.size();  // 4
v == v;    // true
v > v;     // false
v.pop_back();   // changes the array to { 1, 2 } (returns void)
```
and for strings, you can write
```c++
vector<int> s = "abc";
s.push_back('d');
s[0];      // 'a'
s.back();  // 'c'
s.front(); // 'a'
s.empty(); // false
s.size();  // 4
s == s;    // true
s > s;     // false
v.pop_back();   // changes the array to { 1, 2 } (returns void)
```

The STL also defines the methods
```c++
s.clear();                    // clears the string
s.insert(s.begin()+1, 'x');   // insert an 'x' into position 1
q.erase(5,2);                 // remove two elements starting at position 5, reindexing subsequent elements
```

Emplace
===

One method that can be useful is called `emplace`. It is use to construct new elements of the base type of, for example, a `vector`. This is needed because constructing elements and then pushing them into the vector can be cumbersome. Thus, if you have a class `Imaginary` with a constructor that takes two arguments, the real part and the imaginary part, you can do
```c++
vector<Imaginary> r;
r.emplace(r.begin(),2.0,3.0);
```
which creates a `vector` whose first element is the imaginary numer `2+3i`.

Additional For Loop Form
===

A new for loop form is available in C++ as well, allowing you to interate over the elements in a sequential container easily. FOr example, to iterate over the characters in a string, you can do:
```c++
for ( char c : s ) {
    cout << c << "\n";
}
```
Or for a vector, you can write
```c++
vector<string> v = { "i", "am", "on", "a", "very", "bumpy", "flight" };
for (string s : v ) {
    cout << s << "!\n";
}
```
Note that the `for` pattern can request either a copy of the element, or a reference to it. You might want a copy if you are going to change the elements as you iterate through them, as in the following code:
```c++
vector<string> v = { "i", "am", "on", "a", "very", "bumpy", "flight" };
for (string &s : v ) {
    s.push_back('!');
}
```
The new `for` pattern uses the `:` operator. The sequential containers overload this operator to make this possible. If you define a new class, you can [overload this operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8164567/how-to-make-my-custom-type-to-work-with-range-based-for-loops) for your new class as well.

String Methods
===

Because strings are made of characters, it is often helpful to know the methods that are available for manipulating them.
```c++
int isalnum(int c);
int isalpha(int c);
int isblank(int c);  
int iscntrl(int c);
int isdigit(int c);
int isgraph(int c);
int islower(int c);
int isprint(int c);
int ispunct(int c);
int isspace(int c);
int isupper(int c);
int isxdigit(int c);
int tolower(int c);
int toupper(int c);
```
Their names should be self-explanatory. These are in the library `<cctype>`. 

For example, you can use the `toupper` method to convert a string to all caps:
```c++
for ( char &c : q ) {
    c = toupper(c);
}
```

More String Methods
===

The string container also defines a number of string specific methods, such as `assert`, `append`, `replace`, `substr`, and `find` whose definitions are mainly self-explanatory. There are also a number of methods for converting between strings and numbers, such as `to_string` and `atoi`. 

Interestingly, since vectors and strings are dynamic classes much like the `TypedArray` class we built earily, they have a capacity, which you can find with a simple method
```c++
v.capacity(); // some number bigger than v.size();
```
Also, if you need to keep the amount of space a sequential container takes up to a minimum, you can do:
```c++
v.shrink_to_fit();
```

Iterators
===

Before the `for(x:v)` form was introduced, the way to iterate through containers like `vector` and `string` was to use an `iterator`. For example, the following code also changes all the characters in a string to caps:
```c++
for ( string::iterator i = q.begin(); i != q.end(); i++ ) {
    *i = tolower(*i);
}  
```
Here, `q.begin()` returns an iterator that refers to the element at the beginning of the array, while `q.end()` refers to a non-element that is "one past" the end of the array. The notation `i++` is overloaded for iterators to mean "increment the iterator". Finally, the '*' operator is overloaded to return a reference to the element the iterator refers to. 

Iterators with auto
===

Iterators are a good place to use the `auto` keyword. For example, an iterator to a vector of vector of doubles would be declared and initialized by 
```c++
vector<vector<double>>::iterator i = v.begin();
```
and it is a lot easier (and clearer) to write
```c++
auto i = v.begin();
```
I suspect that usages similar to this one were the reason the `auto` keyword was introduced in the first place.

Manipulating Indices
===

Iterators can be manipulated like indices into normal C arrays, via overloaded operators for `+`, `-`, `<`, and so on. For example
```c++
auto i = v.begin();
auto j = i + v.size() / 2;
i < j; // true
```
It should be noted that iterators are *not* numbers. For example, if you do `cout << i`, you will get a compiler error because `i` is not some kind of number for which `<<` is defined, and furthermore, `<<` is not defined for iterators.

**Note:** If you would like to access the elements of a `vector` or `string` in reverse, you can use `v.rbegin()` and `v.rend()` methods. If a `vector` or `string` was declared `const`, you can use `v.cbegin()` and `v.cend()`, which return `const_iterators` instead of `iterators` (just use `auto` if you are unsure). 

Tuples
===

Sometimes you just need to hold a few values in a tuple. For example, you might want two integers, or a string and a double. Here is how you do that in C++ with a [tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple). 

```c++
#include <tuple>
#include <string>

...

using std;
tuple<int, int> x = make_tuple(123,234);
int a = get<0>(x); // 123
int b = get<1>(x): // 234
```

Notice the interesting use of templates in defining the type of `get`. In fact, `get` has something like this signature:

```c++
template< int I, class... Types >
typename std::tuple_element<I, tuple<Types...> >::type const&&
    get( const tuple<Types...>&& t );
```

It uses a size a plain old integer `I` in the template so that it can declare getters for tuples of any size with only one definition.

Please don't ask me what the `&&` operator does. Unless you would like to go on an hour long tangent about move semantics. 

Generic Algorithms
===

The STL uses function polymorphism to let you apply simple algorithms, such as finding and sorting, to pretty much any sequential container. One such method is called `find`. Here are a few examples:
```c++
vector<string> v = { "The", "quick", "brown", "fox" };
string s = "this is a string";
int a[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};      

auto f1 = find(v.begin(), v.end(), "quick");
cout << *f1; // "quick"

auto f2 = find(s.begin(), s.end(), 'i');
cout << *f2; // `i`

auto f3 = find(begin(a), end(a), 6);
cout << *f3; // 6
```
In the first two cases, `find` is using the `begin` and `end` methods of the `vector` and `string` containers. In the last case, we use the global methods `begin` and `end` to construct new iterators for the C style array `a`, which doesn't have any methods of its own. 

The `find` algorithm works on *any* object that defines `==`. Other algorithms, such as `sort` work on any object that defines `<`. That's whjy they are called *generic*.

More Read Only Algorithms
===

Here are a few more *read only* algorithms (ones that do not change their arguments) like find:
```c++
vector<int> v = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, 
            w = { 2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8 };
accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0);    // sum of elements in v
count(v.begin(), v.end(), 3);         // number of occurences of 3 in v
equal(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin()); // true if first v.size() elements are equal to the
                                      // first v.size() elements of w, which must have equal
                                      // or greater length
```
These work equally well on any sequential container of values for which operations like `==` and `+` are defined.

Algorithms that change the underlying array, include things like `sort` and `fill`:
```c++
sort(v.begin(), v.end());                 // sort the elements
fill(v.begin(), v.end(), 1);              // replace element with third argument
fill_n(v.begin(), 3, 1);                  // replace three elements at the beginning with 1
copy(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin() + 3);  // copy v into w starting at position 3
replace(v.begin(), v.end(), 3,-1);        // replace element at position 3 with -1
```

Further documentation on generic algorithms can be found [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/).

Lambda Expressions
===

You can define functions as in two ways in C++. The first is the standard way, as in this example which squares its argument
```c++
double square(double x) {
    return x*x;
}
```
The other is with what are called `lambda` expressions, named after the *lambda calculus* invented by Alonzo Church in the 1930s as a way to capture the essence of computation mathematically. A lambda expression defining the same function as above is:
```c++
[](double x) { return x*x; }
```
It is the same function, but it doesn't have a name. You can use evaluate lambda expressions by applying them like functions, as in:
```c++
([](double x) { return x*x; })(3.0); // 9.0
```
or you can set a variable equal to a lambda expression, and apply it later, as in
```c++
auto square = [](double x) { return x*x; }
square(3.0); // 9.0
```
Using Lambdas with Generic Algorithms
===

Lambdas becomes useful when using generic algorithms, such as `transform`, which take functions as arguments:
```c++
vector<int> v = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
transform(
    v.begin(),    // start of elements to transform
    v.end(),      // end of elements to transform
    v.begin(),      // start of where to put elements to transform
    [](double x) { return x*x; }
);
```
Note that lambda expressions do not return function pointers. Rather, they return function *objects*, which are instantiations of a *function* class which overrides the `()` application operator. 

Capturing Variables
===

The square brackets of a lambda expression can list variables to *capture* from the surrounding scope. For example, if we define a function like this:
```c++
void add_to_all(vector<int> &v, int x) {
    transform(
        v.begin(), 
        v.end(), 
        v.begin(), 
        [](int y) { return x+y; } // WRONG!
    );
}
```
the C++ compiler will complain that the lambda expression does not have access to the variable `x` in its scope. We can fix this by *capturing* `x` as follows:
```c++
void add_to_all(vector<int> &v, int x) {
    transform(
        v.begin(), 
        v.end(), 
        v.begin(), 
        [x](int y) { return x+y; } // RIGHT!
    );
}
```

Callbacks
===

Sometimes you want to send a function to another function. For example, you might do

```c++
sleep_then(10, []() { cout << "Ten seconds have passed\n"; });
cout << "I am waiting\n";
```

If the sleep function executes in another thread waiting for ten seconds and then running its callback, then you would get the output:

```
I am waiting
Ten seconds have passed
```

We will get to code like this in a few weeks.

Example Lambda as Argument
===

```c++
std::vector<int> map(std::vector<int> v, std::function< int(int) > f) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for ( auto x : v ) {
        result.push_back(f(x));
    }
    return result;
}

TEST(Lambda, Argument) {
    std::vector<int> v = { 1,2,3,4,5 };
    auto f = [](int x) { return x*x; };
    std::vector<int> u = map(v, f);
    for ( auto x : u ) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
}
```

Using Templates for Function Arguments
===

template<typename FunctionType>
...

More Info
===

Further reading on lambda expressions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp?view=vs-2017).

Associative Containers
===

Associative containers are different from sequential containers in that they index the container with keys, kind of like a `struct`, dictionary, or database. The associative containers defined in the STL are 'map', 'set', 'multimap', and 'multiset'. We will focus here on 'map', which can be used to illustrate the main features.

 In a `map`, a set of keys are used to index a set of values. For example, you might define a `map` as follows:
 ```c++
    map<string,string> person;
    person["First"] = "Alan";
    person["Last"] = "Turing";
    person["job"] = "Code breaker";
 ```
Note that the `map` template takes two types, the key type and the value type. They do not have to be the same:
```c++
    map<string, vector<int>> sequence;
    sequence["ints"] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
    sequence ["squares"] = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 };
    sequence["fib"] = { 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 };    
```
or another (inefficient) way to make an array of doubles
```c++
map<unsigned int, double> a;
a[0] = 123;
a[5] = 34;
int x = a[3]; // 0. Non-existent keys map to default values of the value type
```
Some implementations of Javascript actually look something like this for arrays.

Map Iterators
===

You can iterate through the keys and values of a `map` with iterators. The order in which the iterators visit the elements of the map is not guaranteed, so do not depend on it. For example, using the definition of `m` above, 
```c++
for(auto i = person.begin(); i != person.end(); i++) {
    cout << (*i).first << ": " << (*i).second << "\n";
}
```
which can also be written
```c++
for(auto i = person.begin(); i != person.end(); i++) {
    cout << i->first << ": " << i->second << "\n";
}
```
When you dereference an iterator in a `map` you get a `pair` object (also defined by the STL). It will have the same types as the map. In the above example, `*i` as the type `pair<string,string>`. The pair object has a `first` and `second` field that references to the actual key and value of the map to which the iterator refers.

You can erase key/value pairs from a map using either keys or iterators.
```c++
m.erase("First");
m.erase(m.begin());
```

More information about map containers can be found [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/).

DB Example
===

To illustrate how to use the various STL containers, we will build a simple database class for storing information about celestial bodies. The class will support:

- Construction of a new database
- Insertion of a new planet name, mass (in earths) and distance (in astronomical units). 
- Assigning entries unique keys
- Deletion of a database entry
- Finding an entry by key
- Search the database with a lambda

The code for this example is in `examples/db.cc`, `examples/db.h`, and `examples/db_tests.cc`. 

DB Example: Public Methods
===

The methods described above are declared formally below.

```c++
class DB {

    // Rows in the database will be of the form
    // [key,name,mass,distance]
    typedef tuple<int,string,double,double> Row;

    DB();
    DB &insert(const string, double, double);
    DB &drop(int);
    Row find(int) const;
    vector<Row> where(function<bool(const Row)> f) const;

};
```

Note the `typedef` allows us to avoid writing out the entire `tuple` definition over and over again.

Also note the use of `const` on the string argument, and in `find` and `where`. 

DB Example: Underlying Implementation
===

Hidden from the user, we need to actually store that data somewhere. One way to do that is with an associative map that makes integer keys to tuple values. 

We will also need a counter for the keys.

```c++
class DB {

  // ...

  private:

    typedef tuple<string,double,double> Value;
    map<int,Value> _data;
    int _next_key;

};
```

Note that it is customary to prefix private variables with an underscore.

DB Example: The constructor
===

In `db.cc` we implement all the methods, starting with the constructor, which just sets the key counter to zero. Since we are using the STL library, we do not need to do any memory allocation.

```c++
DB::DB() : _next_key(0) {}
```

DB Example: Insertion
===

To insert an entry, we compute a key, then map that key to a new tuple that contains the value. 

Note we return `*this` so we can method chain.

```c++
DB &DB::insert(const string name, double mass, double distance) {

    int key = _next_key++;
    _data[key] = make_tuple(name, mass, distance);
    return *this;

}
```

DB Example: Drop
===

To drop the entry corresponding to a given key, we use map's `find` method. It returns an iterator, which we have to make sure is not pointing to `end()`. 

Note we return `*this` so we can method chain.

```c++
DB &DB::drop(int key) {

    auto e = _data.find(key);

    if ( e != _data.end() ) {
        _data.erase(e);
    }

    return *this;
}
```

DB Example: Find
===

To find an entry with a given key, we use map's `find` again. If no such entry is found, an exception is thrown. 

```c++
DB::Row DB::find(int key) const {

    auto e = _data.find(key);

    if ( e != _data.end() ) {
        return to_row(key,e->second);
    } else {
        throw runtime_error("Could not find an entry with the given key");
    }

}
```

This method has to convert the tuple found in the map to a row so it can return it to the user. To make this cleaner, we have defined a private `to_row` function as follows:

```c++
DB::Row DB::to_row(int key, const DB::Value value) const {
    return make_tuple(key, get<0>(value), get<1>(value), get<2>(value));
}
```

Note the use of tuple's templated `get` method.

DB Example: Where
===

Where is pretty interesting. We have to collect all the rows for which the supplied function evaluates to true.

```c++
vector<DB::Row> DB::where(function<bool(const DB::Row)> f) const {

    vector<Row> rows;

    for( auto [key, value] : _data ) {
        auto row = to_row(key,value);
        if ( f(row) == true ) {
            rows.push_back(row);
        }
    }

    return rows;

}
```

DB Example: Testing
===

Here are a few tests.

```c++
TEST(DB,Basics) {

    DB db;

    db.insert("earth", 1, 1)            
        .insert("mars", 0.11, 1.524)
        .insert("moon", 0.011, 1.05)
        .insert("exoplanet one", 1, 1054.4)
        .insert("jupiter", 318, 5.2);

    ASSERT_EQ(NAME(db.find(0)), "earth");

    auto rows = db.where([](DB::Row row) { return  MASS(row) < 1; }); 

    ASSERT_EQ(rows.size(), 2);

    try {
        db.drop(2)                        
            .find(2);  
        FAIL();
    } catch ( runtime_error e ) {
        ASSERT_STREQ(e.what(), "Could not find an entry with the given key");
    }     

}
```

Note that the macros KEY, NAME, MASS, and DISTANCE have been defined for convenience:

```c++
#define KEY get<0>
#define NAME get<1>
#define MASS get<2>
#define DISTANCE get<3>
```

Exercises
===

Start by reading up on the standard template library [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/). Tuples and functionals are described under "Other" in the menu on the left.

1. Write a function called `sort_by_magnitude` that takes a reference to a vector of doubles and sorts it with a comparison function that says that x < y if and only if the absolute value of x is less than the absolute value of y. For example, -5 would be greater than 4 because |-5| > |4|. Use the generic algorithm `sort` (which you can look up on the c++ reference we page) and a lambda expression for your comparison function. Declare this method in `examples.h` as well, and implement it in `examples.cc`. 
1. Write a method 

    ```c++
    vector<int> primes(int n);
    ```
    that returns all the prime numbers less than or equal to `n` using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) method. Declare this method in `examples.h` as well, and implement it in `examples.cc`. 
1. Write a method

    ```c++
    vector<tuple<int,int>> twins(vector<int> nums);
    ```
    that takes a list `nums` of integers and returns all pairs of numbers that are consecutive in the list and differ by two. For example, if you call `twins` on [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,23] you would get [(3,5),(5,7),(11,13)]. Use your function in a test to determine the number of [twin primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime) less than 1000. Note that we may test your code with a larger `n`. Declare this method in `examples.h` as well, and implement it in `examples.cc`. 
1. Modify the `insert` method of the database example to throw a `runtime_error` with the message "Name already exists" if the user attempts to insert a planet with the same name as one already in the database.
1. To the database example, add a method

    ```c++
    Row find_by_name(const string) const;
    ```
    that returns the row in the database whose name matches the argument to the method. It should throw a `runtime_error` with the message "Could not find row by name" if there is no such row.
1. Databases are often tested with randomly generated data. Create a method

    ```c++
    DB &create_test_data(int n);
    ```
    That inserts n random entries into the database. Invent some way to create a different name for each insert (to avoid duplicate names). Names should be at least eight characters long. The mass should vary from 0.01 to 1000 and the distance from 0.1 to 10,000,000. 
1. To the database example, add a method

    ```c++
    int size() const;
    ```
    that returns the number of entries in the database.
1. To the database example, add a method

    ```c++
    double accumulate(function<double(const Row)> f) const;
    ```
    that evaluates `f` on every entry in the database and returns the sum of the results. For example, to find the total mass of a planet, you could write

    ```c++
    double total_mass = db.accumulate([](DB::Row row) { return MASS(row); });
    ```
1. To the database example, add a method, add the methods

    ```c++
    double average_mass() const;
    double average_distance() const;
    ```
    that return the average mass and distance, respectively.

Your homework directory should include
```c++
    db.h
    db.cc
    examples.h
    examples.cc
    main.cc    
    Makefile    
    unit_tests.cc
```
